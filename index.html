  <h2>Today’s Impact — January 3, 2026</h2>
  <p>Even with rain across Bakersfield, CANCAN kept moving. We logged weather-related route delays, published a community update, and advanced our fundraising outreach using our new one-page pitch. Today’s work strengthened our dashboard, refined our modules, and expanded our network of potential partners.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3 funders contacted</li>
    <li>1 story post published</li>
    <li>2 new micro-metrics drafted</li>
    <li>1 volunteer touchpoint</li>
    <li>1 new module documented</li>
  </ul>
  <p>CANCAN continues to prove that small, well-designed actions can move entire neighborhoods — rain or shine.</p>
