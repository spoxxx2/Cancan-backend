## 🚀 The Adaptive Master Strategy

### 🛠 Core Technology
* **aud Engine:** A C++ processing unit that calculates material degradation across a 50-year horizon.
* **Digital Twin Logging:** Every scan generates a JSON object tracking value, danger, and remediation costs.
* **Bio-Acoustic BSFL:** Automated feed-rate calculation for Black Soldier Fly Larvae colonies.

### 📊 The 10/25/50 Forecast
We don't just see trash; we see time.
- **10 Years:** Material Devaluation.
- **25 Years:** Environmental Fragmentation.
- **50 Years:** Remediation Liability.
